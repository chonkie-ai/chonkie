# 🦛 CHONK vs The World

> Look how **THICC** the competition is! Meanwhile, Chonkie be looking slim and trim 💪

Ever wondered how much CHONKier other text splitting libraries are? Well, wonder no more! We've put Chonkie up against some of the most popular RAG libraries out there, and the results are... well, let's just say Moto Moto might need to revise his famous quote!

## 💡 Why These Numbers Matter

### Size Benefits
1. **Faster Installation**: Less to download = faster to get started
2. **Lower Memory Footprint**: Lighter package = less RAM usage
3. **Cleaner Dependencies**: Only install what you actually need
4. **CI/CD Friendly**: Faster builds and deployments

### Speed Benefits
1. **Faster Processing**: Chonkie leads in all chunking methods!
2. **Production Ready**: Optimized for real-world usage
3. **Consistent Performance**: Fast across all chunking types
4. **Scale Friendly**: Process more text in less time

Remember what Chonkie always says:
> "I may be a hippo, but I don't have to be heavy... and I can still run fast!" 🦛✨
